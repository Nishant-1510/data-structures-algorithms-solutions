# Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository documents my structured and concept-driven practice of Data Structures and Algorithms, implemented in Python.
Problems are primarily sourced from LeetCode and are selected to ensure coverage of fundamental topics such as recursion, graph traversal, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms.

# Overview
- Implemented solutions to **100+ Data Structures and Algorithms problems** using Python  
- Focused on core computer science topics:
  - Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables
  - Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
  - Trees and Graphs
  - Recursion and Backtracking
  - Greedy Algorithms and Dynamic Programming
- Problems primarily sourced from *LeetCode* 
- Emphasis on **algorithmic patterns**, **time–space complexity analysis**, and **clean implementations**
- Each solution includes concise documentation of:
  - core idea / approach
  - time complexity
  - space complexity
